I am a software developer with a deep passion for technology. When I was 13 years old, I taught myself how to code and I have been on a continuous journey of learning and improvement ever since. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in computer engineering at University of Palermo, where I am able to further my knowledge in this field and gain a more formal education. I am always eager to take on new challenges and learn something new, as I believe this is the key to personal and professional growth.

In addition to my technical skills and interests, I am also deeply curious about everything around me. In particular, I like learning about finance and philosophy, as I believe these two fields offer a unique perspective on the world and provide me with a well-rounded understanding of the complexities of modern life.
