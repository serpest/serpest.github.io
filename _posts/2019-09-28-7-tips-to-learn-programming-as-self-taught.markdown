Learning a topic from zero as self-taught is always a challenge, but if your aim is to learn programming, there are some tips that could help you.
In this article I will explain what I wanted to know before I started this amazing *journey*.

## 1. Choose a simple programming language
Start to study a simple language, because at the beginning the most important thing is to learn programming principles and logic. For *simple language* I mean a language with a simple syntax.
I suggest to choose [Python](https://www.python.org), because it's very simple and if you have a problem, there is a very big community that can help you. An alternative to Python is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

## 2. Study using a simple book or an online tutorial
Starting as self-taught with a too complex book or tutorial is boring, because you will probably think that programming is too complex for you.
In reality, programming is really exciting, but you can understand it only by having tangible results fast at the beginning, so use a simple book or tutorial and enjoy this world where you are the god.

## 3. Do many problem-solving exercises
Practice is important in every field and in programming it's essential! The exercises should be oriented to problem-solving and not only to language syntax.
For example, the following exercise is great:
> Write a function that, using recursion, converts an integer to a string that contains the integer pronunciation.
> 
> For example: 11 => eleven; 42 => forty-two.

## 4. Always ask yourself "What happens if ...?"
Be curious. When you are studing, if you have a doubt about a special situation, test it executing the code. During the practice try to experiment new solutions, because, if you always do a thing in the same way, you won't learn anything!

## 5. Don't give up
It's always possible not to understand something, but don't give up!
Today there are a lot of nice people online ready to help you, so, if you don't understand something, you can use platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) to get help.

## 6. Start a personal project
After having learnt language principles and syntax, start a personal project. It's a really good way to understand what programming really is, because you often need to find a clever code implementation.
Another key advice is to get some code reviews from someone more experienced. If you don't know anyone that could help you, ask for help in the communities mentioned above.

## 7. There's always something else!
The programming world is really various and big. When you finish to read a book, start a new one of different topic to extend your knowledge!
When you'll find your favorite topic, begin to master it studying more specific books!
